# Introduction 



---

# Background 

**3.3 Subjects**

- 24 Northwestern undergraduate students participated in the experiment.

- All were Native English speakers 


---

# Experiment 

**3.4 Procedues**

- Participants were each presented with a total of 60 dialogues (30 test items, 20 baseline items, 10 filler)
items). 

- The subjects were provided with a script of each dialogue and presented with a prerecorded audio stimulus corresponding to Speaker A’s contribution to each dialogue. 

- The subjects then responded out loud, thereby providing their own assessment of the most natural reading for Speaker B’s contribution.


---

# Experiment

--

**3.5 Results**

--

- Nuclear accents are more likely to occur on either **the NP** or **the verb** than on the preposition

--

- This holds even when the preposition is the only new element. 

--

- **broad-focus** context the accent fell almost exclusively on the NP.

--

- **narrow-focus** accent placement: preposition (32%), NP (64%). 

--

-  **narrow-focus with pronoun substitution**, verb (77%), preposition (15%) of the time.

---

# Experiment 

**3.5 Results**

--

- **Figure 4** shows the distribution of subject performance on baseline items

- A **by-subjects ANOVA** showed that the baseline error and the placement of a given nuclear accent in a narrow focus condition was significantly different. (p < 0.0001), .i.e., there was a statistically supported difference between the baseline and experimental conditions not explained by variance)

# Experiment 

**3.5 Results**

--

- **Paired t-tests** revealed a significant main effect ofbroad versus narrow focus on the proportion of NPs receiving nuclear accents (t = 6.510, p < 0.001) and the proportion of prepositions receiving nuclear accents (t = 4.733, p < 0.001).

--

- **By-items analysis** broad versus narrow focus was found to be a significant main effect for the *proportion of
NPs* receiving nuclear accents (t = 6.161, p < 0.001) as well as for a comparison of the proportions of prepositions receiving a nuclear accent (t = 6.161, p < 0.001).

--

- There was also a significant main effect of broad focus versus narrow focus with pronoun substitution for a comparison of nuclear accented prepositions (t = 2.390, p < 0.024).

--

- Subjects were more likely to place an accent on the preposition if the rest of the VP was given 

--

- Overall, accenting the NP (in the narrow-focus condition) or the verb (in the narrow-focus condition with pronoun
substitution) was preferred to accenting the preposition.

# Experiment

--

**3.6 Discussion**

--

- The results are contrary to the predictions of Schwarzschild (1999) and Selkirk (1984, 1995)

--

- Selkirk: Accents obligatorily generate F-marking 

--

- F-marking is not allowed on nodes that are **given and not contrastive**

--

- (The results showed F-marking on given, non contrastive nodes)

---

# Experiment

**3.6 Discussion**

--

- Schwarzschild: accenting of non-contrastive items is allowed. 

--

- While the results of this study were not predicted by Schwarzschild's model, they do not reject its major premises.

--

- The difference between an accent on the preposition and one on the NP in the narrow-focus context amounts to
a difference of one violation of AVOIDF

---

# Experiment

**3.6 Discussion**

--

- The authors propose the incorporation of insights from Ladd (1980) and Altenberg (1987) into Schwarzschild's model. 

--

- Ladd: word classes are inherently more or less accentable.

--

- Altenberg: found evidence of differential accentuation rates for words by class (low rate for prepositions - ~ 5%)

--

- Based on this evidence, the authors propose a new contraint:
- **ACCPREP**: Do not accent a preposition

---

# Experiment

**3.6 Discussion**

--

- Since the data shows that accent on a preposition is a violation of **AVOIDF**, the authors conclude that **ACCPREP** must dominate **AVOIDF** in the hierarchy. 

-  GIVENness, FOC, *ACCPREP >> AVOIDF >> HEADARG

---

# Experiment

**3.6 Discussion**

But...

--

- How can the results of 23% accent placement on prepositions in narrow-focus conditions be explained?

--

- Variable constraint ranking (Anttila, 1997)

--

- GIVENness, FOC >> AVOIDF >> HEADARG, *ACCPREP

---

# Experiment

**3.6 Discussion**

- Boersma (1997) and Boersma and Hayes (2001): Constraints exist along a continuum of **strictness**

- Constraints are determined stochasitcally: there is non-zero probability that constraint distributions overlap.

```

---

# Experiment

**3.6 Discussion**

- On a given evaluation of the candidate set, if the strictness value for *ACCPREP is to the right of that for AVOIDF, then the accent will occur on the NP or the verb

```{r, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/figure6.png")
```

---


# Experiment

**3.6 Discussion**

- But if the sampled strictness of AVOIDF happens to be higher than that of *ACCPREP, as shown in Figure 7, then the accent will fall on the preposition.

```{r, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/figure7.png")
```

---
# Conclusion 

- Selkirk (1984,1995) and Schwarzschild (1999) make incorrect predictions about accent placement in the context we studied.

--

- Selkirk 1984, 1995 cannot be easily reconciled with the results. 

--

- The authors propose to amend Schwarzschild (1999) with an additonal constraint.

--

- Theory can also explain the high degree of intra-speaker variability revealed by this study

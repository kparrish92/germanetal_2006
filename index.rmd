# Introduction 

- goals
    - to better formalize accent placement using experimental data on accent patterns on constructions with stranded prepositions
    - discuss background and extend Schwarzchild (1999)

## what is a stranded preposition?

- function words are  prosodically weaker and therefore don't usually carry accents

<!-- but Ladd (1980) notes an interesting case of exceptions -> stranded preps -->

- exceptions? stranded prepositions 
  - (1) ex: 
    - A: Why don't you have some French toast?
    - B: There's nothing to make French toast OUT of

- while the default location for the nuclear pitch accent would usually be the noun "French toast" since it's prosodically stronger, the prosodic prominence of the noun is weaker because it was recently mentioned in the discourse. So the nuclear accent appears on the preposition instead

- the current study deals with similar sentences with  more carefully controlled contextual effects as in (2) below
  - (2) ex: 
        - A: Are the children _playing_ their game?
        - B: Paul took down the tent that they _play_ their game IN. 
        
   - in these cases, unlike the first example, "play" is given as it was mentioned previously in the discourse (while "make" wasn't)

## Reference points for current analysis 

### Selkirk 1984,1995 and Schwarzchild 1999

- previous accounts all used AM theory to handle placemnetnts of accents in the default case where the sentence is entirely new.
   - they also provide accent shifting to other locations depending on the structure of the prosodic tree
-**Selkirk** on the other hand, deceloped an explicit account of how focus structure propogates through syntactic trees
   - she preicts that the only play for a pitch accent in examples like 2b is the preposition

-**Scharzchild** offers a signficant contribution in the form of technical formulation of "GIVENNESS"
  - according to schwarzchild, if ou know the set of entailments of the discourse context, then accent placement is predictable 
  - using OT, for any distribution of gien and nongiven constituents in a syntactic tree, a set of hierarchically ranked, violable constraints determines how many accents are necessary and where they should occur 
  
- neither Selkirk nor Schwarzchild discuss phonological constraints on prosodic structure as a possible contributor to nuclear-accent placement though
  - the results of the current study show that prosodic factors compete with discourse-level factors in determining accent placement
  
- spoiler: this study shows that in contexts similar to 2B above, speakers prefer to accent the direct object and tent to avoid placing accents on preps even when they are the only knew information in their clause 
  - this supports Ladd (1980) in saying that we have to take into consideration the inherent prosodic prominence of particular word classes (and preps are relatively weak)
  
  - conclusion: accent placement is best accounted for by a stochastic constraint-based grammar built on Schwarzchild's OT treatment of accent placement

# Theoretical Background 

Since this study relies heavily on previous accounts by Selkirk and Schwarzchild, the following will be an overview of each of these accounts. 

## Selkirk (1984, 1995)

- Selkird relates the locations of accents to the discourse status of individual syntactic nodes

- Syntactic features (following Jackendoff, 1972) called F-markers are assigned to nodes that are NEW while GIVEN nodes remain **unmarked** _unless they signal contrastive meaning_ 

  - the number of locations of accents are determined by a set of rules that constrani the way the F-markers are allowed to project from accented words to other nodes

## Schwarzchild (1999)
